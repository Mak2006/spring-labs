# Run down of new features in Java 
## Java 10, 11
2. Backward compatibilty is present
3. Variable declaration Local variable type inference-  
	1. `List <String> list = new ArrayList<String>();` 
	2. `var = new ArrayList<String>();`  The type is deciphed from how you are initializing it. It means you cannot have `var x;`
	3. Still it is statically typed (not like python);
	4. `var` is a keyword now.
	5.  
4. A cleaner interface to garbage collector interface.  GC is parallel
