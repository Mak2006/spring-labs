# Spring 5.x

1. IOC vs DI - [these are different](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6550700/inversion-of-control-vs-dependency-injection),  IOC is spoken in context of DI becuase the dependecies are inject and that the code does not do it. DI is done by seeter injection, constructor or interface injection. 
2.  Two IOC containers available = Bean context, application context – app context used most as it supports i18n
3.  POJO's – POJO is Plain Old Java Object, can have business methods. Javabeans = POJO with only setter and getters and Spring beans – POJO that is loaded by spring context. DTO is javabeans which traverses layers.
