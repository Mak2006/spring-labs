1. 1.  IOC vs DI
2. IOC is done by seeter injection, constructor or interface inject
        
3.  Two IOC containers availabel = bean context, application context – app context used most as it supports i18n
    
4.  POJO's – POJO is Plain Old Java Object, can have business methods. Javabeans = POJO with only setter and getters and Spring beans – POJO that is loaded by spring context. DTO is javabeans which traverses layers.
