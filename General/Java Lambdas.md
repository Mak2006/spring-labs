# Java Lambdas
1. Introduced in Java 8
2. Lambda is defined by the `->`. Method references by operator `::` 
3. Two new packages are added `iava.util.function` and `java.util.streams`
4. Syntax - *(lamba  argumeents)* ->*(lambda body)* 
this is equivalent is a loose sense to 
```
public void somefunction(/* lambda arguments */) {
/* lambda body */
}
```
**since we are not defining any function explicity**, we are able to omit the call to it.
