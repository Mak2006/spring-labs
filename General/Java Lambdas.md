# Java Lambdas
1. Introduced in Java 8. 
2. Lambda is inline function definition and call to itself. 
3. Lambda is defined by the `->`. Method references by operator `::` 
4. Two new packages are added `iava.util.function` and `java.util.streams`
5. Syntax - *(lamba  argumeents)* ->*(lambda body)* 
this is equivalent is a loose sense to 
```
public void somefunction(/* lambda arguments */) {
/* lambda body */
}
```
7. Points to note
    1. **No explicit call** - since we are not defining any function explicity, we are able to omit the call to it. 
    2.  **Arg types**  - Sin
