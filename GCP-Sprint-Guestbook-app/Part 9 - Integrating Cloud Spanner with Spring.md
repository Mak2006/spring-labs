# Integrating Cloud Spanner with Spring
Cloud Spanner is an enterprise-grade, globally distributed, strongly consistent database service built for the cloud specifically to combine the benefits of relational database structure with non-relational horizontal scale. This combination delivers high-performance transactions and strong consistency across rows, regions, and continents with enterprise-grade security.

In this lab, you update your application to use the Spring Cloud GCP starter for Cloud Spanner, test the changes locally in Cloud Shell, and then redeploy the backend service to App Engine.
