Google Cloud Platform (GPC) has a bucket-based object storage solution called Cloud Storage. Cloud Storage is designed to store a large number of files and a large volume of binary data, so that you don't need to manage your own file systems or file sharing services. Cloud Storage can be used directly by many other GPC products. For example, you can store data files on Cloud Storage and process those data filesin a managed Hadoop (Cloud Dataproc) cluster. You can also import structured data stored on Cloud Storage directly into BigQuery for ad hoc data analytics using standard SQL.

Cloud Storage provides fast, low-cost, highly durable, global object storage for developers and enterprises that need to manage unstructured file data. In Cloud Storage, the consistent API, low latency, and speed across storage classes simplify development integration and reduce code complexity.
