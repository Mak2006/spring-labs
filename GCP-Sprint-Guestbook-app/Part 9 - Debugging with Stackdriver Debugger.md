# Using the GCP Cloud debugger
Cloud Debugger is a feature of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that enables you to inspect the state of an application at any code location, without stopping or slowing down the running app. Cloud Debugger makes it easier to view the application state without adding logging statements.

You can use Cloud Debugger with any deployment of your application, including test, development, and production. Cloud Debugger adds less than 10 milliseconds to the request latency only when the application state is captured. In most cases, this additional latency is not noticeable by users.
