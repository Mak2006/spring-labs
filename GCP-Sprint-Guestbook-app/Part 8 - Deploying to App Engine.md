# Deploying application to Google App Engine
App Engine is Google's fully managed serverless application platform. With App Engine, you can build and deploy applications on a fully managed platform and scale your applications without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. App Engine includes capabilities such as automatic scaling-up and scaling-down of your application, and fully managed patching and management of your servers.

In this lab, you deploy the application into App Engine. You need to convert the application from fat WARs into the thin-WAR deployments that App Engine can deploy.
